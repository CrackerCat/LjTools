Download and make LuaJIT 2.0 and copy LuaJit.pri to the src directory, 
then adjust the include directive in the pro file to point to this 
pri file. The LuaJIT make is necessary because a couple of required
files are generated and not originally part of the source tree.
Maybe you have to rename the .S file created by LuaJIT make 
to .s (lowercase).
